# AI-Native Startup Classification -- 267,790 crunchbase startups

1. **Large-scale Classification pipeline of Crunchbase Data** to determine if AI/ML is fundamental to the value proposition of startups.

2. **Conduct a comparative statistical analysis** of GPT-5-mini and GPT-5-nano models, evaluating their reasoning quality, classification characteristics, and cost-effectiveness. Beyond simple accuracy metrics, I analyzed agreement patterns, confidence distributions, correlation between model outputs, and the specific nature of disagreements to understand each model's "personality" and practical tradeoffs for production use.
