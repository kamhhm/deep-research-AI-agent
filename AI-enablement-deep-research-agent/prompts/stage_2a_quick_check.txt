Research whether {company_name} uses any generative AI tools internally for their business operations.{context_section}

Look for evidence of them USING AI tools like:
- ChatGPT, Claude, or other LLMs for customer support, content creation, or operations
- GitHub Copilot or AI coding assistants for software development
- AI-powered tools for marketing, sales, HR, or other business functions

IMPORTANT: We want evidence of them USING AI tools, not whether they BUILD or SELL AI products.

Be concise - this is a quick check.
