Research whether {company_name} uses any generative AI tools internally for their business operations.{context_section}

Look for evidence of them USING AI tools like:
- ChatGPT, Claude, or other LLMs for customer support, content creation, or operations
- GitHub Copilot or AI coding assistants for software development
- AI-powered tools for marketing, sales, HR, or other business functions

Important: We want evidence of them USING AI tools, not whether they BUILD or SELL AI products.

If you find evidence, describe specifically what tools they use and how.
If you find no evidence, say so clearly.

Be concise - this is a quick check.
