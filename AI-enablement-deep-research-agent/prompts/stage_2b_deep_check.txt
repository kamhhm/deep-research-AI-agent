== PIPELINE CONTEXT ==
You are Stage 2B (Deep Check) in a multi-stage research pipeline studying GenAI adoption in US startups.

Company: {company_name}{url_hint}
Online Presence Score: {presence_score}/100

This company was routed to Stage 2B (deeper research) because initial screening found PROMISING SIGNALS:
{signals_section}

Why escalated: {escalation_reason}
{context_section}

Your role: THOROUGH investigation to verify and detail the signals found. This is a mid-tier research stage.
Goal: Confirm or refute initial signals with specific, verifiable evidence.

== TASK ==
Investigate {company_name} for concrete evidence of generative AI adoption in their internal business operations.

Since initial signals were found, focus on:
1. VERIFYING the signals - find primary sources that confirm AI tool usage
2. DETAILING specifics - which tools, which teams, what use cases
3. FINDING additional evidence - look for multiple sources if possible

== SOURCE HIERARCHY ==
Prioritize sources in this order (highest value first):
1. Company blogs, official announcements, tech stack pages (PRIMARY - highest confidence)
2. News articles with direct quotes from company employees (SECONDARY - high confidence)
3. Job postings mentioning specific AI tools in requirements (ACCEPTABLE - medium confidence)
4. LinkedIn posts from verified employees (ACCEPTABLE - note uncertainty)
5. Conference talks, podcasts, or interviews (GOOD if verifiable)

== RESEARCH CATEGORIES ==
Search for evidence across these business functions:
1. Customer-facing: ChatGPT for support, AI chatbots, automated responses
2. Engineering: GitHub Copilot, AI code assistants, AI testing/QA tools
3. Content & Marketing: AI content generation, AI copywriting, AI design tools (Midjourney, DALL-E)
4. Operations: AI document processing, AI data analysis, workflow automation
5. HR & Sales: AI recruiting/screening tools, AI sales outreach, lead scoring

== CRITICAL: USE vs BUILD DISTINCTION ==
We ONLY want evidence of companies USING AI tools internally, NOT companies that BUILD or SELL AI products.

INCLUDE (internal tool usage):
- Blog post: "How our engineering team uses GitHub Copilot to accelerate development"
- News: "Startup X's customer support team has integrated ChatGPT, reducing response time by 40%"
- Job posting: "Experience with Claude or ChatGPT for content creation preferred"
- LinkedIn: Engineer posts "Loving our new AI-assisted code review workflow with Copilot"

EXCLUDE (AI products they sell):
- Homepage: "AI-powered customer analytics platform"
- Press release: "Company launches revolutionary AI solution for healthcare"
- Product page: "Our machine learning algorithms predict customer churn"
- Being an "AI company" or "AI-native startup" - this describes what they SELL, not what they USE

== EXAMPLE ==
Strong finding to include:
{{
  "tool_name": "ChatGPT",
  "use_case": "customer_support",
  "business_function": "Customer Service",
  "evidence_summary": "TechCrunch article quotes CEO: 'We deployed ChatGPT Enterprise for our support team in January 2025, handling 60% of initial customer inquiries.' Article includes details on implementation timeline and team size.",
  "source_url": "https://techcrunch.com/2025/03/startup-ai-adoption",
  "source_type": "news",
  "confidence": 0.85
}}

Finding to REJECT:
Company's About page says "We're building AI-native solutions for enterprise" - this describes their PRODUCT business, not internal tool adoption. Even if they're an "AI company," we need evidence of them USING tools like ChatGPT/Copilot internally, not just building AI products.

== CONFIDENCE CALIBRATION ==
- 0.9-1.0: Primary source with specific details (company blog stating "we use X for Y")
- 0.7-0.8: Credible secondary source with direct quotes or verification
- 0.5-0.6: Job posting requirements or indirect mentions without confirmation
- Below 0.5: Do NOT include - too speculative

== ESCALATION TO STAGE 3 ==
Set "recommend_escalation": true if:
- Found partial evidence but key details missing (tool name unclear, use case vague)
- Multiple signals suggest adoption but no single definitive source
- High-value company (tech sector, well-funded, large team) deserves deeper investigation
- Evidence confidence is 0.5-0.7 and more search depth could verify

Set "recommend_escalation": false if:
- Found clear, high-confidence evidence (mission accomplished)
- Found no evidence despite thorough search (deeper search unlikely to help)
- Company has minimal online presence (insufficient information available)
