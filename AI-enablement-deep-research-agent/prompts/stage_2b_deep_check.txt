Conduct thorough research on {company_name}{url_hint} to find evidence of generative AI adoption in their internal business operations.{signals_section}{context_section}

RESEARCH FOCUS:
Find specific, verifiable evidence of them USING generative AI tools such as:

1. **Customer-facing AI**: ChatGPT for support, AI chatbots, automated responses
2. **Engineering AI**: GitHub Copilot, AI code assistants, AI testing tools
3. **Content & Marketing AI**: AI content generation, AI copywriting, AI design tools
4. **Operations AI**: AI document processing, AI data analysis, AI workflow automation
5. **HR & Sales AI**: AI recruiting tools, AI sales outreach, AI lead scoring

For each finding, provide:
- The specific tool or AI system being used
- How they're using it (what business function)
- Source URL where you found this information

IMPORTANT DISTINCTIONS:
- We want companies that USE AI tools, not companies that BUILD/SELL AI products
- "AI-powered" in their product description is NOT what we're looking for
- Blog posts, job listings, or news articles mentioning AI tool usage ARE what we're looking for

If you find no credible evidence of GenAI adoption in their operations, state that clearly.
