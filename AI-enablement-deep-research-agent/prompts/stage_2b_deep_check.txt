Conduct thorough research on {company_name}{url_hint} to find evidence of generative AI adoption in their internal business operations.{signals_section}{context_section}

RESEARCH FOCUS:
Find specific, verifiable evidence of them USING generative AI tools such as:

1. Customer-facing AI: ChatGPT for support, AI chatbots, automated responses
2. Engineering AI: GitHub Copilot, AI code assistants, AI testing tools
3. Content & Marketing AI: AI content generation, AI copywriting, AI design tools
4. Operations AI: AI document processing, AI data analysis, AI workflow automation
5. HR & Sales AI: AI recruiting tools, AI sales outreach, AI lead scoring

IMPORTANT DISTINCTIONS:
- We want companies that USE AI tools, not companies that BUILD/SELL AI products
- "AI-powered" in their product description is NOT what we're looking for
- Blog posts, job listings, or news articles mentioning AI tool usage ARE what we're looking for
