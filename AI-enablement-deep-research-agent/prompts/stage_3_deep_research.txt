Conduct comprehensive deep research on {company_name}{url_hint} to document their adoption of generative AI tools in business operations.{previous_section}{context_section}

RESEARCH OBJECTIVES:

1. **Verify and Detail**: For any AI tools they use, find:
   - Specific tool names (ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot, etc.)
   - Specific use cases (customer support, code review, content creation, etc.)
   - Scale of adoption (team-wide, company-wide, specific departments)
   - Timeline (when they started using it)

2. **Source Types to Check**:
   - Company blog posts and announcements
   - Press releases and news coverage
   - Job postings mentioning AI tools
   - LinkedIn posts from employees
   - Conference talks or podcasts featuring company leaders
   - Tech stack pages or engineering blogs

3. **Evidence Quality**:
   - Primary sources (company's own statements) are best
   - News coverage with quotes is good
   - Inference from job postings is acceptable but note uncertainty

OUTPUT FORMAT:
For each piece of evidence found, provide:
- Finding: [What AI tool/usage was found]
- Source: [URL]
- Confidence: [High/Medium/Low based on source quality]
- Details: [Specific information about the usage]

If comprehensive research yields no evidence of GenAI adoption, state that with confidence.
